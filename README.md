## Technologies

## Description

I designed and built a robust single-page application using the popular MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Leveraging my expertise in MongoDB, I developed a comprehensive database schema and utilized Mongoose to establish seamless communication between the database and the application.

One of the key features of the application was a powerful filtering functionality that allowed users to view data based on continent. This feature was implemented using React and was designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for users.

Overall, my experience in building applications with the MERN stack allowed me to create a high-quality, scalable, and performant single-page application that effectively met the needs of the project.
